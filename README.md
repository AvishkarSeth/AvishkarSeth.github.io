# AvishkarSeth.github.io

I'm [Avishkar Seth](https://avishkarseth.github.io/#home), a Robotics Research Engineer at Macquarie University. I work with robotics, avionics, and sensing systems, with a strong focus on aerial robot autonomy. I enjoy turning ideas into working systems and guiding others through training and practical learning. I’m also interested in entrepreneurship and the business side of technology, especially where engineering meets real impact. At my core, I’m curious. I believe the meaning of life is to live fully, explore, connect, and keep expanding our understanding of humanity and the universe around us. This shapes the way I work & build. I’m open to meaningful collaborations in robotics, innovation, and applied research.
