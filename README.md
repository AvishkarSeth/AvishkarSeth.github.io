Avishkar Seth's Research & Projects

As an engineer born in Mumbai, I've always been passionate about technology. At the [MQ Drone Lab](https://www.mqdronelab.com/)
in Sydney, I'm living my dream of putting autonomy into drones and robots. When not tinkering with sensors and code, 
I'm strumming my guitar, traveling to new places, and seeking unique experiences. Sharing my love for tech 
and teaching Mechatronics and IoT to students fuels my soul. Sci-fi movies may be fantasy, but with each new 
drone or robot I create, I'm bringing more of that future into reality.
